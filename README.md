## Project Goals

- Analyze hospital performance using Power BI
- Identify operational inefficiencies and performance bottlenecks
- Optimize resource utilization and patient flow
- Support data-driven decision-making with predictive insights
- Improve patient outcomes and overall service quality

## Overall Hospital Operations

- Departments Analyzed: 4 (Oncology, Cardiology, Emergencyand Pediatrics)
- Admitted Percentage: 66.77%, meaning two-thirds of patients seen are admitted
- Waiting Cases: 34.2%, which is relatively high and may indicate bottlenecks in patient processing or limited bed availability
- Hospital utilization is strong but high waiting cases suggest operational constraints that could affect patient satisfaction

##  Bed Occupancy by Department

- Pediatrics operates near full capacity with a 91.67% bed occupancy rate, signaling sustained high demand and potential capacity constraints that may impact service delivery if not addressed
- Cardiology maintains a high utilization level at 88.57%, indicating strong demand and efficient use of available resources, though continued monitoring is required to prevent overcrowding
- Oncology records a 76.25% occupancy rate, reflecting balanced utilization with some flexibility to absorb fluctuations in patient volume
- Emergency shows a markedly low occupancy rate of 29%, which may mean quick discharges  but it could also point to resource over-allocation, lower admission rates or opportunities to reallocate resources to higher-demand departments

## Admission Status by Department

- Oncology records the highest number of admissions at 131, closely followed by Cardiology with 128 admissions, indicating strong and consistent demand for specialized care services
- The Emergency department reports 122 admissions, reflecting steady patient inflow that aligns with its role as a primary access point for acute care
- Pediatrics follows with 119 admissions, showing slightly lower but still comparable demand relative to other departments
- Overall, admissions are fairly balanced across all departments, suggesting stable and evenly distributed demand for hospital services, with no single department experiencing extreme pressure or underutilization

## Visits by Time and Day

- Visits peak between 8:00 AM and 3:00 PM with the heaviest activity around 12:00 PM – 2:00 PM
- Weekdays (Tuesday–Thursday) show the highest visit density
- Patient inflow is concentrated during midday hours and midweek, creating predictable peak load times for staffing and scheduling

## Patient Analysis 

- The hospital has a total patient count of 30, which has remained stable with no significant month-to-month fluctuations, indicating consistent service demand
- New patient intake is high at 29, reflecting steady growth and ongoing community engagement, while 30 returning patients demonstrate strong retention and patient loyalty
- However, the readmission rate of 34.6% is moderately high, suggesting the presence of chronic illness cases or potential quality-of-care issues that warrant further investigation 
- Overall, while patient retention is strong, the elevated readmission rate highlights an area for operational and clinical review to improve outcomes

## Visits by Month

- Total Visits: 500 annually
- Peak Months: Around July and December, suggesting seasonal surges (possibly flu season or year-end checkups)
- Low Months: March and October
- Hospital demand fluctuates seasonally ,staff scheduling and supply inventory should adjust accordingly

## Patient Demographics

- The largest patient group falls within the 18–35 age range, comprising 11 patients, indicating that young adults form the core of the hospital’s patient base 
- A significant portion of patients, 8 in total, are aged 60 and above, highlighting a notable elderly population that may require focused chronic disease management and geriatric care services
- Pediatric patients (0–18 years) are stable at 6 individuals, suggesting consistent demand for pediatric care
- The 35–60 age group represents the smallest segment with 5 patients, indicating lower utilization among middle-aged adults
- Overall, the hospital serves a diverse demographic, with the bulk of patients being young adults and seniors, underscoring the need for a broad range of services spanning preventive care, acute treatment, and chronic disease management

## Patient Geography

- Top Locations: United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Spain
- Suggests international patient base, possibly due to specialized treatment offerings or medical tourism
- International reach presents opportunities for brand expansion and premium care services

## Chronic Illness & Marital Status

- Many patients have chronic conditions, particularly among married males
- Average visit duration ranges 32–42 minutes, indicating moderate consultation complexity
- Chronic illness management programs and longer consultations align with patient needs but these require efficient doctor scheduling and support systems

# Strategic Recommendations

## Operational Efficiency

1. Reduce Waiting Cases (34.2%)

- Implement an online appointment and triage system to prioritize emergency and chronic cases
- Reassess staff allocation during peak hours (12–2 PM)
- Review discharge and admission workflows to speed up bed turnover

2. Balance Department Capacity
 
- Pediatrics and Cardiology may require additional beds or staffing to prevent overcapacity issues
- Consider shifting non-critical patients from high-demand units to departments with available capacity (e.g., Oncology)

##  Clinical and Quality Improvement

3. Address Readmission Rate (34.6%)

- Conduct root cause analysis on common readmission cases (e.g., follow-up compliance, chronic disease relapse)
- Introduce post-discharge follow-up programs and teleconsultations for high-risk patients
- Strengthen patient education on medication adherence and home care

4. Enhance Preventive Care for Key Age Groups

- Develop wellness and screening packages targeting: Young adults (fitness, mental health) and Seniors (chronic illness monitoring, rehabilitation)
- Partner with local employers for corporate wellness programs

## Resource & Staff Management

5. Optimize Staffing Patterns

- Align shift schedules with visit peaks (midday and weekdays)
- Offer flexible shifts to handle morning rush hours effectively
- Ensure pediatric and cardiology units have adequate nursing and diagnostic support

6. Departmental Resource Reallocation

- Evaluate Emergency department resources , reduce excess beds or shift staff to higher-demand departments

## Strategic Growth

7. Expand International Patient Services

- Strengthen partnerships with overseas healthcare agents
- Offer concierge or telehealth pre-arrival consultations
- Highlight successful specialty treatments (e.g., cardiology, oncology) in marketing campaigns

8. Implement Predictive Analytics

- Use patient data to forecast seasonal demand and adjust supply chains (medications, staff, beds)
- Predict readmission likelihood using chronic illness and visit history data

# Overall Business Impact 

By implementing these recommendations, the hospital can achieve:

1. Financial Impacts

- Higher patient throughput without additional infrastructure
- Increased revenue from preventive care and international services
- Reduced operational costs from smart staffing and resource optimization

2. Operational Impacts

- Streamlined workflow and reduced delays
- More efficient use of beds, staff and equipment

3. Clinical Impacts

- Better patient outcomes and lower readmissions
- Higher compliance with healthcare quality standards

4. Customer Experience Impacts

- Shorter wait times
- Improved satisfaction and loyalty
- Enhanced hospital reputation and trust

# Tools Used

- Power BI for dashboard design and interactive analytics
- Data Modeling and DAX Measures for KPIs
